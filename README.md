## Exercise 1: Design Pattern Implementation

This exercise demonstrates the implementation of six fundamental design patterns through console-based Java applications, organized into three categories:

### Behavioural Design Patterns

**1. YouTube Subscribe & Notify System**
- **Pattern:** Observer Pattern

**2. Song Playlist Management System**
- **Pattern:** Iterator Pattern

### Creational Design Patterns

**3. Employee Factory System**
- **Pattern:** Factory Pattern

**4. Logger Application**
- **Pattern:** Singleton Pattern

### Structural Design Patterns

**5. PC Control Application**
- **Pattern:** Facade Pattern

**6. Phone Charging System**
- **Pattern:** Adapter Pattern

> **Note:** Detailed documentation for each design pattern implementation is available in the `Exercise1_Design_Pattern/` folder.

## Exercise 2: Mini Project

### Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer Application

A comprehensive console-based application for managing astronaut schedules and tasks, built using multiple design patterns working together.

**Implemented Patterns:**
- **Singleton Pattern** - Ensures single instance of schedule manager
- **Factory Pattern** - Creates different types of tasks dynamically
- **Observer Pattern** - Notifies users of schedule conflicts and updates

**Key Features:**
- Add, remove, and view scheduled tasks
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Priority-based task management
- Real-time notifications for schedule changes

> **Note:** Complete project documentation and implementation details are available in the `Exercise2_Mini_Project/Astronaut_Daily_Schedule_Organizer/` folder.
